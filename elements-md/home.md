- Project title: UCL, GOSH and Avanade - Situated Cognition 360 Editor 2021
## An abstract should include three paragraphs and the following contents
### Problem statement
- Building an editor with layers and interactive timeline hotspots that apply situated cognition 360 videos to a handful of human factors training sessions during a series of emergency scenarios. 
### Your solution
- We solved this problem by building a player and an editor separately using Unity. 
- For the editor, users can add hotspots by right-click on their mouse and open an input panel with a left-click. The input panel allows user to add a name, some description text, an explanatory image and a link to another video to the hotspot. All the information on hotspots will be stored into a json file.
- For the player, it can read the json file and add the hotspots to its location with all its attached information. The user will be able to watch the video and click on the hotspots for extra information.
### Achievement and impact
- We managed to release 2 executable files (for the editor and the player) which allows the user to edit and present the annotated 360 videos.
-	Doctors are able to deliver training sessions more easily with hotspots and 360 videos, and their students can learn more clearly and efficiently.
